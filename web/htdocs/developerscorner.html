<h1>JDEE Developer's Corner</h1>

<p>Welcome to the JDEE Developer's Corner. This page explains what
you need to do to participate in the development of the JDEE.</p>

<h2>Becoming a JDEE Developer</h2>

<p>To become a JDEE developer: </p>

<ol>
    <li>
      <p>Subscribe to the JDE developer <a href="developerscorner.html#MailingLists">mailing lists</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Install cvs client software on your development system
      (see <a href="developerscorner.html#Repository" >Using the JDE Source Code Repository</a>).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Create a JDEE sandbox on your development system.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Download and install <a href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/bugtrack-1.3.1.tar.gz" >Bugtrack</a>.<p>

      <p>Bugtrack is the Emacs-based bugtracking
      system used to track JDEE bugs and new feature and feature
      enhancement requests. The Bugtrack database for the JDEE, BUGS, is in the JDEE's
      root directory. Use Bugtrack as your to-do list.</p>

      leader</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Implement and test features/bug fixes in your sandbox.</P>

<h2><a name="#Repository">Using the JDEE Source Code Repository</a></h2>

<h3>About the Source Code Repository</h3>

<p>The JDEE source code repository contains the latest development
version of the JDEE source code. The repository is maintained by
Sunsite Denmark and controlled by the Concurrent Version System
(CVS) system. Anyone with Internet access and CVS client
software can check source files out of the repository.
Only authorized persons can update the repository.</p>

<h3>Installing CVS Client Software</h3>

<p>You need to install CVS client software on your system. The
client allows you to check source files out of the repository,
and, if you have commit access, commit updated files to the
repository. CVS client software is widely and freely available.
If you plan to develop under Windows, I recommend that you use
Cyclic's <a href="cvs-1_10-win.zip">Windows port</a> of the CVS
client. The CVS client is a command-line application. The <a
href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/pcl-cvs.tar.gz">pcl-cvs</a> package provides an Emacs
interface to the client.</p>

<h3>Updating the Repository</h3>

<p>Developers can update the source code in the repository by </p>

<ul>
    <li>posting patches to the JDEE <a
        href="mailto:jde-patches@sunsite.dk">patches mailing
        list</a></li>
    <li>committing updated files to the repository via CVS</li>
</ul>

<p>Only developers with commit access to the repository can
submit changes directly. Everyone else must submit changes to the
patches mailing list. The changes are reviewed and committed by
developers with commit accces.</p>

<h4>Requesting Commit Access to the Repository</h4>

<p>You may request commit access to the repository. Before doing
so, it is a good idea to first submit a few changes via the
patches mailing list to establish your credentials as a
developer. Then, email your request to the <a
href="mailto:paulk@mathworks.com">repository administrator</a>.
Your request should specifiy the following information: </p>

<ul>
    <li>user name by which you would like to be known to the
        repository</li>
    <li>password to gain access to the repository (specify if the
        password is crypt-encoded)</li>
    <li>email address to which repository notifications should be
        sent</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be notified by email when you have been granted
commit access.</p>

<h4>Logging onto the Repository</h4>

<p>If you have commit access, you can log into the repository as
yourself. To log in as yourself, open a command shell and enter:</p>

<p><font face="Courier">cvs -d
:pserver:USERNAME@sunsite.dk:/pack/anoncvs login</font></p>

<p>where USERNAME is your user name. The cvs client prompts you
to enter your password. </p>

<p>Anyone can login into the repository anonymously. As an
anonymous user, you have read but not write access to the
repository. To log in anonymously, enter</p>

<p><font face="Courier">cvs -d
:pserver:cvs@sunsite.dk:/pack/anoncvs login</font></p>

<p>Then, enter <font face="Courier">cvs</font> at the password
prompt.</p>

<h4>Creating a JDEE Sandbox</h4>

<p>To create a sandbox, log into the repository. Next change to
the directory on your system in which you want to create the
sandbox. Then check out the JDEE source code. The following
example illustrates how to create a sandbox, using a command
shell:</p>

<p><font face="Courier">&gt; cvs -d
:pserver:cvs@sunsite.dk:/pack/anoncvs login<br>
(Logging in to cvs@sunsite.dk)<br>
CVS password: cvs<br>
&gt; mkdir jde-sandbox<br>
&gt; cd jde-sandbox<br>
&gt; cvs -d :pserver:cvs@sunsite.dk:/pack/anoncvs co jde<br>
... (checkout messages)<br>
&gt; cvs -d :pserver:cvs@sunsite.dk:/pack/anoncvs logout</font></p>


<h2><a name="MailingLists"></a>Communicating with Other JDEE Developers</a></h2>

<p>JDE developers use the following mailing lists to coordinate
development activities: </p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="mailto:jde-devel@sunsite.dk">jde-devel</a> <p>Used
        by developers to discuss JDE development issues and
        business. The JDE source code repository sends commit and
        watch notifications to this mailing list as well. To
        subscribe, send an empty message to <a
        href="mailto:jde-devel-subscribe@sunsite.dk">jde-devel-subscribe</a>.
        To unsubscribe, send an empty message to <a
        href="mailto:jde-devel-unsubscribe@sunsite.dk">jde-devel-unsubscribe</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="mailto:jde-patches@sunsite.dk">jde-patches</a>
        <p>Used by developers who do not commit access to the
        repository to post patches to the JDE source code.
        Patches posted to this mailing list are reviewed and
        committed by members who do have commit access. To
        subscribe, send an empty message to <a
        href="mailto:jde-patches-subscribe@sunsite.dk">jde-patches-subscribe</a>.
        To unsubscribe, send an empty message to <a
